## Creating Plugins

Add a plugin JSON file to this repo along with an appropriate icon in the
[icons directory](icons/).

After creating the JSON file and adding an icon, add the plugin to the
[INDEX file](INDEX). If the plugin is approved, it appears in the list of iocage
plugins.

For more detailed information on creating a plugin, see [Create a Plugin][].

## Installing Plugins

### Using A Local File

Install a plugin using a local file:

```sh
iocage fetch -P /path/to/local/file.json ip4_addr="vnet0|$ipaddress"
```

where `$ipaddress` is the desired IP address for the plugin. For example,
`ip4_addr="vnet0|10.238.4.196"`.

### Pulling From The Internet

Install a plugin from the internet:

```sh
iocage fetch \
  -P gitea \
  -g https://github.com/fnichol/iocage-plugin-index \
  ip4_addr="vnet0|$ipaddress"
```

where `$ipaddress` is the desired IP address for the plugin. For example,
`ip4_addr="vnet0|192.168.0.91"`

## Contributing

You are invited to contribute to new features, fixes, or updates, large or
small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to
process them as fast as we can.

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub
issue][issues], especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other
contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on
your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.

## Release History

This project uses a "deployable main" strategy, meaning that the `main` branch
is assumed to be working and production ready. As such there is no formal
versioning process and therefore also no formal changelog documentation.
